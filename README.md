3. **Navigate to the Repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the repository.

4. **Run the Tool**: To start using our SSH tunnel setup tool, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo run --release --bin ssh-tunnel
    ```

   This command launches our tool in interactive mode, guiding you through the setup process step by step. Follow the prompts to enter the required information, including:

    - Jump host username and address
    - Target host username and address
    - SSH ports for the jump host and target host
    - Whether you want to enable port forwarding

5. **Sit Back and Relax**: Once you've provided all the necessary information, our tool handles the rest! It establishes the SSH tunnel according to your specifications, ensuring a seamless and secure connection between your local machine and the target host.

6. **Advanced Options**: For users comfortable with command-line parameters, our tool also supports non-interactive mode. Simply provide the required information as command-line arguments when running the tool. For example:

    ```bash
    cargo run --release --bin rssh-tunnel tunnel --jump-host-user <jump_host_user> --jump-host <jump_host_address> --target-host-user <target_host_user> --target-host <target_host_address> --jump-port <jump_ssh_port> --target-port <target_ssh_port> --port-forward <true/false>
    ```

   Replace `<jump_host_user>`, `<jump_host_address>`, `<target_host_user>`, `<target_host_address>`, `<jump_ssh_port>`, `<target_ssh_port>`, and `<true/false>` with your desired values.

7. **Enjoy Secure Communication**: With the SSH tunnel successfully established, you can now enjoy secure communication between your local machine and the target host. Whether you're accessing remote resources or forwarding ports for specific services, our tool ensures a hassle-free experience every time!
